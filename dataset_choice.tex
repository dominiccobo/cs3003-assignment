\subsection{What is Jenkins ?}

Jenkins started off as a do-it-all automation tool as an alternative to CRON. It has evolved to become one of the most flexible, extensible continuous integration and delivery platforms in industry.

\subsection{Why Jenkins ?}

The extremely extensible nature of Jenkins suggests that as a tool it is likely to be very maintainable; however, a certain notoriety follows Jenkins around when talking about Jenkins its unpredictable behaviour. 

Newer products in the market have taken to limiting extensibility in favour of standardisation and convention; this is suggestive of a potential issue with extreme modifiability and lack of testability.
